In order to compile the escape environment, you must first add a few
components to the library:

Delphi 1:
1. copy delphi\bin\complib.dcl to your_dir\bin\complib.dcl
2. Options->Open Library, select your_dir\bin\complib.dcl
3. Options->Install Components, Add your_dir\source\compos.pas

Delphi 2:
1. copy Program Files\Borland\Delphi2.0\bin\cmplib32.dcl to your_dir\bin\cmplib32.dcl
2. Component->Open Library, select your_dir\bin\cmplib32.dcl
3. Component->Install Components, Add your_dir\source\compos.pas

Delphi 3:
1. Componen6->Install Component, Add your_dir\source\compos.pas

Then load the project escape.dpr. Make sure that complete boolean evaluation, overflow 
checking and range checking are of (you can find these under compiler options). Now you
can go ahead and compile the escape environment.
